# Resume Screening with K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier

This project utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to analyze and classify resumes from the [Kaggle resume dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/gauravduttakiit/resume-dataset).

## Project Structure

- **main.py:** Contains the code for building and running the Streamlit application.
- **tfidf.pkl:** Stores the results of the TF-IDF vectorization of the resume text data.
- **ResumeScreening.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook where the KNN model is built and trained.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be downloaded from Kaggle using the following command:
```
kaggle datasets download -d gauravduttakiit/resume-dataset
```
